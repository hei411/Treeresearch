# Treeresearch
Here are all the files used in the experiment of tree comparisons

For both algorithms, the input is as follows:
Input numbers M and N, representing number of trees and number of nodes respectively.
Then for each tree,the label of the nodes are inputted, and all edges are described as well.
Edges are presented with 2 numbers, with the former node being the parent of the latter.

For data generating program, the input is as follows:
Input numbers M and N, representing number of trees and number of nodes respectively.
